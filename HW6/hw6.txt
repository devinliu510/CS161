HW #6

1.
	a. {x/A, y/B, z/B}
	b. No valid unifier
	c. {x/B, y/A}
	d. {x/John, y/John}
	e. No valid unifier

2. 
	a.  ^ = AND
        v = OR
        ~ = NOT

        ∀x (Food(x) → Likes(John, x))
        Food(Apples)
        Food(Chicken)
        ∀x ∃y (Eats(y,x) ^ ~Kill(x,y) → Food(x))
        ∃x ∀y (Kill(x,y) → ~Alive(y))
        Eats(Bill, Peanuts) ^ Alive(Bill)
        ∀x (Eats(Bill, x) → Eats(Sue, x))
   
     b. 1. ~Food(x) v Likes(John, x)
        2. Food(Apples)
        3. Food(Chicken)
        4. ~Eats(g(x),x) v Kill(x,g(x)) v Food(x)
        5. ~Kill(g(y),y) v ~Alive(y)
        6. Eats(Bill, Peanuts)
        7. Alive(Bill)
        8. ~Eats(Bill, x) v Eats(Sue, x)


   c.   9. Kill(Peanuts, Bill) v Food(Peanuts)         Resolve 4 and 6, with unifier 
                                                        {x/Peanuts, y/Bill}
        10. ~Kill(Peanuts, Bill)                                Resolve 5 and 7
        11. Food(Peanuts)                                Resolve 9 and 10
        12. Likes(John, Peanuts)                        Resolve 1 and 11


   d.   13. Eats(Sue, Peanuts)                        Resolve 6 and 8 with unifier
                                                        {x/Peanuts}
		Therefore, Sue eats peanuts.


   e.   First order:
                ∀x ∃y (~Eats(y,x) → Die(y))
                ∀y (Die(y) → ~Alive(y))
                Alive(Bill)


        CNF:
                14. Eats(y,x) v Die(y)
                15. ~Die(y) v ~Alive(y)
                16. Alive(Bill)


        Resolution:
                17. ~Die(Bill)                Resolve 15 and 16 with unifier {y/Bill}
                18. Eats(Bill, x)        Resolve 14 and 17 
                19. Eats(Sue, x)        Resolve 8 and 18


                Since the unifier has no value for x, we cannot conclude anything on 
                what Sue eats. 
        
3.      a) Is the instance satisfiable?  
                The instance is not satisfiable with only 3 colors.


        b) Do the conversion again, this time, with 4 colors. Use RSat to solve this new SAT 
            instance. Is the instance satisfiable?  
                The instance is satisfiable with 4 colors. 


        c) What do the answers of these two SAT instances tell you about the graph coloring 
            problem of the above graph? Can you give a solution (a coloring) to the graph coloring 
            problem of the above graph based on the results of RSat? 
                The minimum number of colors needed to satisfy the graph is 4 colors.
                
                Sample solution: 
                                Colors: R,G,B,Y
                                1 → R
                                2 → G
                                3 → R
                                4 → B
                                5 → G
                                6 → Y
                                7 → B
        d) Now, use a similar approach to solve the graph coloring of the graph described in 
            graph2.txt. What is the minimum number of colors required to properly color this 
             graph? 
                The minimum number of colors is 8.
